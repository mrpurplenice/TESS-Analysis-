# TESS-Analysis-
The TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) telescope is a space-based telescope that is designed to search for exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars outside of our Solar System. TESS looks for exoplanets by observing the stars in our galaxy and looking for small dips in their brightness. These dips in brightness can indicate that a planet is passing in front of the star, or "transiting."

To find new exoplanets, TESS first looks at large areas of the sky, called sectors, and takes pictures of the stars in those areas. These pictures are called "light curves," which show how the brightness of a star changes over time. TESS takes these light curves by measuring the amount of light coming from a star every 2 minutes, and looks for any dips in brightness that happen regularly and last for a short period of time. These dips can indicate that a planet is transiting the star.

Data taken from TESS satelites to look for indicators of a transiting exoplanet. The aim of this algorithm is to look for specific characteristics, such as the size of the planet and the temperature which in this case are trying to look for an exoplanet which is roughly around the same size as the planet eartha and roughly the same sufrace temperature.
